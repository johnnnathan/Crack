This challenge just requires us to get the correct flag so we can use a just a debugger. Inside the main function there is a variable initialized with the value "FK?DwObbkJ^di_V?_c0R4L\\Me". Giving that value as input to the program and looking at the CPU registers will show us "AG{ThisShouldNotBeHard}". For some reason the flag is cut off, but giving "FLAG{ThisShouldNotBeHard}" as the input will show us a success message.

Have a great day :)
