Solution to "VaultCrack" by psyr3n


Although a simple challenge, I got to use my custom tool "Harpocrates" to solve this. 

Load the executable into ghidra, or any other disassembler/decompiler. You will find a method by the name of _check_password. 
Inside you can see the initialization of a lot of values. They are all in hex, which you likely will not be able to 
decode yourself. At the end of the function you can find a strcmp call with parameters, the parameter passed to it and 
the string created through the hex values.

Using my app, or literally any other that completes the same operation, you can add all the values sequentially, as
they are shown in the function and decode them into an ASCII representation, which will allow us to use it as input. 
It spells out "Be_White_Hat", which when passed as the password will give you a "Welcome !" message.

Have a great day :)
