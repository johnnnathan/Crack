This is the first .NET application that I have cracked, so I needed some new tools to crack this program.
I did attempt to use ghidra to decompile, and x64dbg to debug but neither of them were helpful. JetBrains' "dotPeek" application
is a wonderful tool that I'll use instead. 

The program just asks for a password, which probably means there won't be any moving part in the back-end. I looked at the Form object, 
which probably is what we see when we run the app, and under it there are a few more components. The checkButton component immediately 
caught my attention, since there will probably be a password check close to its declaration in the code. The first line shows 

"if (this.keyfield.Text == "XOQIBwcLudyp6NG")"

which when tried results in a success screen.



Have a great day :)
