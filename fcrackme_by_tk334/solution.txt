The program reads our username and password and then verifies if it is a correct combination. The program runs the length of the username through a function that determines if it's from 2 to 7 characters long the correct password is the username with "@fsociety" appended to the end of it. If it's longer than 7 characters it adds "Mr." to the start of the username as the password.

  

Example:

Username:
 as 
Password:
 as@fsociety 

Username:
 asdasdas 
Password:
 Mr.asdasdas 

Have a great day :)
