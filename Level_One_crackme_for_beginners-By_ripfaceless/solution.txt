This program requires us to pass the password as an argument. Inside the main function a conditional checks if an argument has been given, and if it has it compares the given password against the stored password inside the _validate_key function. Inside it we can find "uedfluefeqcfdofodcsdoweogey4857498549fneuncqpn" which serves as the stored password. 

Have a great day :)
