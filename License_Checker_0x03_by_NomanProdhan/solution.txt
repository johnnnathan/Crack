Inside the main function there is a loop where every character of the input is passed through the "atoi" c function in order to 
retrieve the decimal value of an ASCII character("7" for example has an ASCII value of 55 but a value of 7 if passed through atoi). 
The generated values are summed up and after the loop is finished the sum is compared against the decimal value 50 or 0x32. 
If the sum is equal to the value then the success message is shown.

I was able to generate many valid keys but the program does not compute the sum of strings longer than 7 characters long properly, 
meaning that certain valid strings were not accepted.


Have a great day :)
