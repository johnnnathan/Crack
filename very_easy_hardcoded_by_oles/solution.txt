This application has been written in Visual Basic so that means that we can use dotPeek to get the decompiled source code of the program. There is a "WindowsApp11.My" object and a "Form1" object inside it. In the "Button1_Click" function there is a comparison between the given pass and the stored pass. The stored pass is "123QWERTY123" and giving that as input will change the name of the window to "Registered"

Have a great day :)
