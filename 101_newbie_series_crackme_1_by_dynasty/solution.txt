Open the exeucutable in your disassembler of choice. We can see a printf call asking the user for the password and a scanf after. The given password is compared against the value `1234`. Giving `1234` as input to the program will result in 5 "You cracked it!" messages being printed in the terminal.

Have a great day :)
