The first level of this game requires us to gather 5 Million coins, this would take too long of course to do manually so we will have 
to find the memory location that holds the value of collected coins. This can be done using CheatEngine. 
Attach CE to the process and then start scanning the memory. Since the value of collected coins appears above the the player 
model we can use that as the input to the Exact Value Scan Type. Since many memory addresses can hold the same value we will have to do 
it a few times to ensure that the address we have found is the correct one. We can identify the correct address by modifying the value 
that it holds and seeing the impact that it has on the game. Raising the correct value to 5 million will result in the Coin number, 
and the wall that was blocking us from accessing Level 2, disappearing.

Level 2 requires us to modify the y value of the player. We can use relative comparisons, with an unknown first value to find the 
address as we did before. Find a platform and jump up and down while continuing to scan for relative values. One thing that you should 
note is the fact that since the origin point of the coordinate system is positioned at the top-left corner, the y value decreases, 
instead of increasing, when moving up(GUI libraries like javafx work the same way). There are more addresses this time with the same 
value, many of them mirroring the address that we are searching for, but the correct one can be found using method we used for Level 1. 
Change the value of the correct address to -1200, follow the maze until you have reached the end.
