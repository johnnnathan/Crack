The program given is a Jar file, since it has been written in the java language. Jar files can be decompiled well using any online tool. Inside the main functin we can see that the stored password is reversed and the result compared against the given password. The stored password can be found inside the "dat/data.java" file and if we reverse it using CyberChef and give it as input we will get a success message.
The stored key is "TSRQ-PONM-LKJI-HGFE-DCBA" so "ABCD-EFGH-IJKL-MNOP-QRST" is the correct password.

Have a great day :)
