In the entry function we can find a lot of method calls. There are about a dozen functions that print messages and one fgets function that handles input. At the end of the print statements and before the loop we can find a line where a variable is initialized with the value "Terry Davis was awesome !". Giving that as the input will open a new window with a "Congratulations!" message.

Have a great day :)
R.I.P. King Terry Davis
