This is a .NET application so we can use dotPeek to get the full decompilation of the program. Inside WindowsApplication2/Form1/Button1_Click function there is a concatenation of strings that the password is compared against. The password must be equal to Label6.Text + Label7.Text + Username + Label8.Text. If they are equal a success message is shown.

Example:

Label6 = 092
Label7 = 246
Label8 = 21
Username = 123

Password = 09224612321

Have a great day :)
