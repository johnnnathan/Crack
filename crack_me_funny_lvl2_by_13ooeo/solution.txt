At first, the program asks us to decide if we want to open the crackme, open the credits or exit out. Opening the crackme will ask us to provide a username and a password. The fifth character of the username is compared against the character '@' and the password is compared against "pointerhell". If both are correct a success message is shown.

Example. 
  Username: ABCD@FG
  Password: pointerhell


Have a great day :)
