This challenge is unique because we only need to find the flag, not a username/password combination. The main function is simple and keeps printing "try harder ..." whenever we run it. Inside the "generate_flag()" function there is a printf call with "flag{Danof4edx_flag}" as the argument. 

Have a great day :)
