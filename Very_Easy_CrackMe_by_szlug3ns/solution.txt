For this challenge we can use only a debugger to find the password. Inside the main function set a breakpoint before the memcmp call and look at the CPU registers, inside rdx you will be able to find "1ecc7dd7b9763028e119e5046268d922" which if given as input will show us a "Congrats!" message.

Have a great day :)
