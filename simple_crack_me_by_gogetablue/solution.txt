I was not able to run this program but we are able to find the password using static analysis only. Open the executable using ghidra and locate the main function. Inside it there is a memcmp call using as arguments our given password and "K4F1AXxF4LZ". Giving the stored string as input to the program should print "Successfully logged in" to the terminal. 

Have a great day :)
