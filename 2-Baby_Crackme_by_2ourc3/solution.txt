Inside the "FUN" function that is called from the main function we can find the encrtypted flag. "Nkrru$ngiqkxy" is a string encrypted using the caesar cipher. We can retrieve the plaintext using the dcode caesar cipher decoder. Brute-forcing the decryption and looking through the results will give us the string "Hello&Hackers".

Have a great day :)
