Another .NET program. We will use dotPeek just as we did for "dotqw's first crackme". 
I put the application in the program and started searching for objects that I could use to find the password.
This crackme uses a gui which makes it easier to detect value handling. I found a method by the name of "GenerateSerialKey" and knew
I was close. I looked at the contents of the method and it divided the key into three segments. The first segment 
was the basic username, the second the username with "salt1" appended to it and the third one the username with "salt2" appended to it.
GenerateSegment was the function that handled all the logic behind the key generation. Since we do not have to deal with assembly, or 
pseudocode we can easily transform the .NET code into usable python code.

It computes the sha256 hash of the individual segment and then iterates over the first two indexes of the hash while doing some 
calculations. It mods the value of the character on the current intex and the one at an offset of 2, using the value 36.
Then it takes the ASCII code and through a simple if statement, calculates the values that the segment's key should consist of.

Example:
  Username: abcd
  Key     : S2W3-I0WI-D9LM


Have a great day :)
