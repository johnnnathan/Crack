The program first asks for a License Key and then calls the "dogrula" function with it as an argument. Inside it a lot of string objects are created and initialized with different values. The given string is compared against the string at location "local_48", which corresponds to y3qrcbfa32q. Giving y3qrcbfa32q to the program as the License key will result in "True" being printed to the terminal.

  

Have a great day :)
