The main function starts with printing a message and asking for input. After that a lot of operations occur that are difficult to understand. At the bottom of the function there is a memcmp call with the given and the stored password. The stored password is stored in plaintext and if we give "^254N;bQF5x*qu" as input we will get shown an "Access granted!" message.

Have a great day :)
